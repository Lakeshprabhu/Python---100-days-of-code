# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#It is iterating through a range of numbers from 1 till 19
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#When the value of i become equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#That it will eventually become 20
